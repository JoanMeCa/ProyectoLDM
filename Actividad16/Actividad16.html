        <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
        <h2>Raiden</h2>
        <p>"I’ll pick my own name...and my own life...I'll find something worth passing on"</p>
        <h2>Samuel Rodrigues</h2>
        <p>"Two years, I've been working towards this, and on the last day, Blondie has me doubting the whole thing. We'll leave it up to fate then, shall we, Wolfy? A duel to the death. May the best man win. I cut him down, and that's that. Back to our regularly scheduled international incident. But if he beats me... if I die here... the lock on my blade will disable after a couple hours. What happens after that... is up to you, Wolfy."</p>
        <h2>Blade Wolf</h2>
        <p>"I possess an intellect far beyond human reckoning."</p>
        <h2>Monsoon</h2>
        <p>"Free will is a myth, religion is a joke, we are all pawns controlled by something greater: <b>Memes</b>, the DNA of the soul."</p>
        <h2>Mistral</h2>
        <p>"I lost my whole family, everything... But I butchered those fuckers. My family's killers. That's when I realized... I am a killer too. And a good one at that."</p>
        <h2>Sundowner</h2>
        <p>"Like I said, kids are cruel, Jack. And I'm very in touch with my inner child!"</p>
        <h2>Steven Armstrong</h2>
        <p>"You still don't get it. I'm using war as a business to get elected... so I can end war as a business! In my new America, people will die and kill for what they BELIEVE! Not for money. Not for oil! Not for what they're told is right. Every man will be free to fight his own wars!"</p>
